/**
 * Used by API-4 and API-6: {@code <multicast aggregationStrategy="scoreAggregationStrategy">}
 *
 * <p><b>What an AggregationStrategy is</b>: multicast, split, aggregate and enrich - every EIP
 * that turns one message into many or many into one - has to answer the same question:
 * <i>how do the replies of several branches become a single message?</i> This interface is
 * that answer.
 *
 * <p><b>The contract</b> (worth memorising; getting it wrong is the usual bug):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>on the first call {@code oldExchange == null}, so return {@code newExchange} as the seed;</li>
 *   <li>for every later branch, merge it into {@code oldExchange} and <b>return oldExchange</b>;</li>
 *   <li>Camel calls this serially by default (it holds a lock), so no synchronisation is needed
 *       here; only {@code parallelAggregate} demands a thread-safe implementation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a multicast declares no aggregationStrategy, Camel's default is to <b>discard every
 * branch reply</b> and keep the message as it was before the multicast - the single most common
 * surprise for newcomers.
